# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Using-Machine-Learning

In this project, I:

• Developed a ML model that detected and classified various traffic signs in Python.

• Trained and tested the convolutional neural network using Keras and TensorFlow.

• Achieved an accuracy of 95.80% when tested against over 1000 images.

To run the program, download and extract all the files into the same directory. Then, open code_cnnbuilder.py file and run the program to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN). Finally, run code_tester.py file to test the program against images within the tsrd_test folder.

Note: You MUST change the directory of the files according to your computer for the code_tester.py file. Otherwise, the program will not work and complain the files you are referring to cannot be found.

If you have any more questions, feel free to message me!
